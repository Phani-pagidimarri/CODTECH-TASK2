### OverView Of the Project

## Project: Temperature Converter Using C 

## Objective 
The aim of this Project is to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. This Program allows the user to input a temperature in one scale and output the converted temperature in another scale. 

## Key Activities
# 1. Input Handling:

The program accepts user input (temperature values and menu choices) and validates it for correctness.
Error handling for invalid inputs ensures the program operates robustly.


# 2. Menu-Driven Interaction:

A simple text-based interface allows the user to select options for conversions or exit the program.
Loops and conditions control the flow of the menu and repeat tasks as needed.


# 3.Temperature Conversion:

Mathematical computations are performed based on standard formulas:
        Celsius to Fahrenheit : F= (C *9/5)+32
        Fahrenheit to Celsius : C= (F-32)*5/9
        
 
# 4.Modularity:

The program uses functions (celsiusToFahrenheit and fahrenheitToCelsius) to separate temperature conversion logic from the main workflow.
Improves code readability and reusability.


# 5.Control Flow:

do-while loop ensures the program runs repeatedly until the user decides to exit.
switch-case structure handles user choices for better clarity.


# 6.Output Formatting:

Provides formatted and user-friendly output for the converted values.
